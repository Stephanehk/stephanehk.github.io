Hello!

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Stanford University and a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Broadly, my research interests center around

(1) building safe AI systems that do what humans actually want.\\
(2) preventing unsafe decision-making systems from being deployed. 

I completed my undergraudate degree in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked closely with [Prof. Brad Knox](https://bradknox.net/), [Prof. Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/), and [Prof. Scott Niekum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/) on problems in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Please see my publications for more information, and don't hesitate to reach out!
